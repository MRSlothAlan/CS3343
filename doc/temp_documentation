1. The priority queue
	=> basically, I just override the comparator of the Dish class.
	=> The dish type has the first priority.
	   Dish type: 
	 		appetizer = 0
	 		main = 1
	 		desert = 2
	=> The incoming time has the second priority
	   First come first served.
	=> There is an allowance variable in each Dish class
	   Dickson : allowance is the time permitted for dishes to delay start the cooking
	   => I think this variable is being considered in the schedule generation function.

2. A cooking schedule shall be generated in the Kitchen class.
	=> Just get an instance of the reception class,
		You can get the Dishes one by one.
